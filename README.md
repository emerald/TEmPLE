# Why?

The Emerald programming language offers an [interesting programming
model](https://learn-emerald.org/docs/methodology.html), but an
otherwise aging syntax, semantics, and implementation. This repository
seeks to provide a more up-to-date (as of 2018) implementation of the
Emerald programming methodology.
